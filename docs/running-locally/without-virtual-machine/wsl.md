# Windows Subsystem for Linux

It might be possible to run the application somewhat within Windows, but that is not to be discussed within this documentation.

Preferable instead is [installing WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

And to increase your productivity with such a setup, you can:

- [Setup VS Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode) to remote into and manage your WSL environment for you.
- [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/) for managing containers.

With the above things installed, you _should_ be able to follow the [getting started tutorial](./getting-started.md) as-is from the Linux command line provided by WSL.

_As always, if you run into issues, make sure to ask for help, and if you figure things out, leave notes in the docs for future developers!_
