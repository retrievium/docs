# Tasks

## Data Ingestion

- [ ] Ingestion of existing data on compute canada into new system
- [ ] Search based on formula
- [ ] Search based on functional group
- [ ] Search based on number of ring atoms
- [ ] Search based on number of specific atoms

## Visuals

- [ ] 2D/3D structure display based on information in CML (more expansive than just smiles-based 3D view)
- [ ] Restore spectra diagrams

## Searching / Navigation

- [ ] Implement paging
- [ ] Clear search

Next to the 'Search' button, add a new button, that is red, and states 'Clear'.

- [ ] Add feature to download files (ex. Gaussian input file, Cartesians, molfile)
- [ ] Sliders to search for items with numerical values
- [ ] Drop-down menus for search criteria with fixed options (ex. Basis set)

## Misc / Future

- [ ] Hide retrievium information in raw CML
- [ ] Users for retrievium.ca
- [ ] User upload of files – staging area
- [ ] Input SMILES of reactants and products and get delta H
