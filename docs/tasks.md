# Tasks

## Meta

- [ ] Development Servers for Students - **Jack**

Will likely be following https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Terraform

## Data Ingestion

- [ ] Ingestion of structures - **Jack**

Need to figure out changes in CML since ~2020, and get some new data to play with.

- [ ] Search based on formula
- [ ] Search based on functional group
- [ ] Search based on number of ring atoms
- [ ] Search based on number of specific atoms

## Visuals

- [ ] Restore 2D/3D structure display - Tannia
- [ ] Restore spectra diagrams - Tannia

## Searching / Navigation

- [ ] Implement paging
- [ ] Clear search

Next to the 'Search' button, add a new button, that is red, and states 'Clear'.

When you click it, all of the search fields should be cleared.

- [ ] Clean-up of labels displayed in search results (ie. Not CML tags) - **Aidan**
- [ ] Implement selection options for information to be displayed in search results
- [ ] Add feature to download files (ex. Gaussian input file, Cartesians, molfile) - Tannia
- [ ] Sliders to search for items with numerical values

- [ ] Drop-down menus for search criteria with fixed options (ex. Basis set)

## Misc / Future

- [ ] Hide retrievium information in raw CML
- [ ] Users for retrievium.ca
- [ ] User upload of files – staging area
- [ ] Input SMILES of reactants and products and get delta H
